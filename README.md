  Deploy a set of webservers
behind a load balancer in AWS or Azure.

·        Should include a test to see
if the TF is valid (TF Validate) and cancel if it’s not.

·        Configure those servers to
install / configure the web server portion and create a web page

·        One web server shows one text
or color. The next web server shows another color or text.

·        Configuration could be done
via Ansible, Bash, Python. Doesn’t matter. The configuration
shouldn’t be baked into the TF and should be a separate process that kicks off
after the TF deploy is successful

·        Test the existence of those
web servers and if they are browse-able.

·        Display a message for the
status of those webservers.

So the above process is demonstrating an understand of 

·        Terraform

·        Unit Testing in two ways

·        Configuration

·        Orchestration
